# CiniVibe
An Android app made inspired by Goodreads but for movies! CiniVibe is a place where users are able to search through various movies and their descriptions. From there, they can add them to three available lists is they want: a watchlist, a wishlist, and a favorites list. In addition, using The Movie Database, CiniVibe is constantly updated with the most recent movie releases.
