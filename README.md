# CiniVibe
An Android app inspired by Goodreads but for movies! CiniVibe is an app where users can look through various movie and organize them based on three different lists: a watched list, a wishlist, and a favorites list. In addition, using The Movie Database API, CiniVibe is constantly updated with the most recent movie releases, so users can check out new movies as they release!
